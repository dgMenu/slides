          <h2>Introduction</h2>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p style="text-align:left;">dgMenu is a digital menu system which aims to replace the traditional menus
            available in various
            restaurants,
            bars, cafes & other outlets. The purpose of this is known from the name itself and that is to digitalize the
            menu. Keeping in mind the amount of paper & other material goes into the use of the menu & the maintenance,
            our team came up with dgMenu. A step taken to modernize & Improvise for the betterment of the society.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p style="text-align:left;">So, this dgMenu will be basically available in restaurants, bars, cafes & various
            outlets. A QR Code will
            be present at the venue or at the table you're sitting at, so a user just needs to scan the code & the menu
            will be present on their phone. Users just need to go through the menu & order. Items in the menu are
            updated on a daily basis.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p style="text-align:left;">Keeping in mind the present situation i.e. the COVID - 19 pandemic, this method
            works effectively due to the
            restrictions that are imposed like keeping safe distance between people, avoiding touching things in public
            places & others. “Contact less” is the word the outlets can use to make the customers safe.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p style="text-align:left;">In the dgMenu, there are no hardships faced in making changes or updating the menu
            items. A simple UI is
            maintained, so that the restaurant/cafe owner or the I.T person in charge of the module, is able to find it
            simple & easier to work on.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p style="text-align:left;">Fast food stalls & other outlets are gonna gain from this module/system as their
            food inventory keeps on
            increasing with new dishes which ultimately will attract more & more customers & so, the workload of the
            menu
            will reduce due to dgMenu.</p>

          <h2>Problems with Existing Systems</h2>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p style="text-align:left;">According to our survey, we learned that most of the restaurants using digital
            menu systems ask the users to download a PDF in order to access the menu. This becomes quite irritating as
            the customer would not like to download unwanted files on his phone. Also, the other reason is that
            downloading these PDFs could invite free virus to your phone.
          </p>

        <section data-auto-animate>
          <p style="text-align:left;">Another important aspect that caught our eye was not only about the above 2
            restaurants but others also, where:

          <p style="text-align:left;">Another important aspect that caught our eye was not only about the above 2
            restaurants but others also, where:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A particular dish is present on the menu, but not available at that moment.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>A particular dish is present on the menu, but not available at that moment.</li>
            <li>So, a dish is available, but the prices are not updated to the newer one.</li>
          </ul>

            <li>So, a dish is available, but the prices are not updated to the newer one.</li>
            <li>The problem arises specially with Goan Dishes as the restaurants mention “As Per Size” or “As per
              Season”
              where they do not show the rate & ultimately can charge you any amount.</li>

          <h2>Need for the project</h2>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p style="text-align:left;">The main benefit dgMenu system provides is eliminating the use of paper
            completely. dgMenu system can
            benefit the GenZ restaurants and cafes in multiple ways, it will be quite time saving for busy restaurants
            as the menu will suggest “you eat what you see”, so whenever the waiter is up for the order you already know
            what to eat.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p style="text-align:left;">It will be an add on advantage for the people who prefer contact less menus
            especially in times
            of COVID19 wherein the customer will only have to scan the menu without actually getting in contact with the
            paper menu.
          </p>

          <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p style="text-align:left;">As we know that many of the restaurants in Goa still follow the paper menu system
            i.e whenever a customer
            enters a restaurant he is provided with a paper menu. The problem that lies in the traditional paper menu
            system is that whenever the menu list is updated, new printouts have to be taken off the menu.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p style="text-align:left;">This leads to
            violation of nature since there is unnecessary wastage of paper.
            Better way to tackle this situation could be scanning a QR code and an updated menu list appears.

          <h2>Summary</h2>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p style="text-align:left;">dgMenu, which is a digital menu system, aims to replace the traditional menus
            available in various restaurants, bars, cafes & other outlets. A QR code will be present at the venue or
            at
            the table one is sitting at, so they just need to scan the code & the menu will be present on their phone.
            Users need to go through the menu & then place their order with the steward. Items in the menu are updated
            on a daily basis.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p style="text-align:left;">A short survey was carried out on some restaurants, where the working of their
            systems was observed, which is similar to the dgMenu and the problems existing with those were pin pointed
            and made sure that they didn't exist in dgMenu.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p style="text-align:left;">Keeping in mind the issues i.e. to cut down usage of paper, digitized menu to
            reduce work and other aspects were mentioned in the need for this particular dgMenu system. This system
            that
            we students have built basically aims to improve and modernize the traditional menu system.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <p style="text-align:left;">Further hardware requirements and other aspects like the use case, class and
            entity relationship diagram are shown to just get an overview of how the static system is going to work.
            Keeping in mind the limitations, that is the need for internet access and also the need for smartphones.
